\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Data mining classifiers tend to optimize the performance by focusing on the 
majority class first. That means that they perform poorly when dealing with
imbalanced datasets, where the minority class is outnumbered by the number of
samples of the majority class; or when samples overlap. In real world problems,
this kind of distribution is common. This thesis tries to analyze those metrics
(and others) to see what complexity metrics affect the classification
performance. The thesis also tries to apply some techniques that should improve
the performance of the classifiers, measured by analytical from the confusion
matrix.
